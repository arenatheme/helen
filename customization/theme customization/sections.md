Sections let you empower merchants by giving them greater flexibility when customizing their online store ([source](https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/introducing-sections-for-shopify-themes)). 
There are two types of Sections: Static and Dynamic.

{% sample lang="Static sections" %}

### **Static sections:** 
        
Static sections are sections which will be added statically to specific parts or pages of the theme. Static sections basically have all the functions like dynamic ones, except they can not be moved.
        
If a section is separated from others via top and bottom spaces, it is static.
